The interaction of femtosecond laser pulse with magnetic material triggers transfer of energy from the electrons into spin and lattice systems. The developments in various time-resolved pump-probe techniques allowed us to explore such interactions between these reservoirs, in metals, that occur at sub-picosecond to picosecond timescales. Investigating the interactions at ultrashort timescales is a key to obtain control over many phenomena such as ultrafast demagnetization, laser-induced magnetization reversal (all-optical switching), super-diffusive spin-transport, and even laser-induced magnetic phase-transition. My research goal is to explore mechanisms involving the aforementioned phenomena in advanced magnetic materials suitable for energy efficient spintronic technologies operating at terahertz (THz) frequencies.\nIn my talk, I will address potential mechanisms involving the helicity (circular polarization)-independent and helicity-dependent all-optical switching (AOS) processes in both ferrimagnetic GdFeCo and ferromagnetic Co/Pt thin film systems. It has been demonstrated, in metallic magnets, that the loss of spin ordering to the laser excitation, i.e., ultrafast demagnetization triggers a flow of spin-polarized current oscillating at terahertz frequencies, which will eventually be converted to THz charge current when a heavy metal layer is placed next to the magnetic layer. I will present the laser-driven THz-signals, in Co/Pt bilayers, and their sensitivity to varied roughness, crystal structure, and intermixing at the interface. Finally, I will discuss the timescales of laser-induced phase-transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase in FeRh. Excitation of antiferromagnetic FeRh/Pt bilayer by femtosecond laser pulses results in an efficient emission of nearly single cycle THz pulse being an evidence for laser-induced changes of the magnetization in FeRh. The study based on double pump THz-emission spectroscopy technique reveals that the laser-induced phase-transition emerges at sub-nanosecond timescale, the speed that yields a further control over phase-transition by means of both temperature and applied magnetic field.\nSpeaker Bio: Dr. Rajasekhar Medapalli is a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Memory and Recording Research, University of California San Diego. His research mainly focuses on the all-optical control of (magnetic-)materials at nanometer length scales. He also fabricates rare-earth thin films based spintronic devices suitable for terahertz spintronics.Dr. Medapalli received his Ph.D. in Physics from Radboud University Nijmegen in 2014 focusing on efficient optical control of magnetization dynamics in metallic alloys. Prior to this, he received his M.Tech degree (Nanotechnology) from Amity University in 2009 and M.Sc degree (Physics) from Andhra University in 2007.\nEvent Date: 15th April, 2019(Monday)\nEvent Time: 02:00 PM to 03:00 PM\nVenue: Room 119 IIT Dharwad, Karnataka\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

J. Jagadeesha, former Engineer/Scientist, ISRO\nTitle: Geomatics Engineering Applications and Small Satellites for Sustainable Development\nAbstarct:\nGeomatics includes the tools and techniques used in land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), global-navigation satellite\nsystems (GPS, GLONASS,IRNSS,Bediu,Compass), photogrammetry, geophysics, geography , and related forms of earth mapping. Following the advanced developments in digital image/\nsignal data processing, the nature of the tasks required of the professional land surveyor has evolved and the term \"surveying\" no longer accurately covers the whole range of tasks that\nthe profession deals with. As our societies become more complex, information with a spatial position associated with it becomes more critical to decision-making, both from a personal\nand a business perspective, and also from a community and a large-scale governmental viewpoint.This lecture for about 45 minutes introduces you to remote sensing (satellite, aerial, UAV) ,\nimage processing and GIS, GPS and its applications. An introduction to applications using world scenario will be followed with Indian applications in remote sensing and geomatics\nengineering in general.The small satellites are going to be complementary to large satellites in future. An academic program towards building small satellites and geoinformatics engineering applications goes a\nlong way in building systems engineering / precise engineering specialists. The natural resources engineering like, water resources engineering, mining engineering, agricultural /\nhorticultural engineering, biodiversity and climate engineering need precision engineers.Several practical applications using ISRO data products are going to be explained in brief in\nthe talk.Precision approach: Right action at the right place at the right time is the only way forward for an agriculture pressed on every side. The aim of sustainable agriculture is to obtain\nefficient yield without environmental damage or pollution. Precision farming is based on the understanding of soil and plant variability and applying variable management accordingly.\nHyperspectral remote sensing, NIR remote sensing, IRNSS navigation receivers , drones, IoT/ICT , sensor networks are going to help in improving agricultural productivity of\nagricultural precision agriculture areas.\nSpeaker Bio: C J Jagadeesha received the graduate degree in civil engineering from Karnataka Regional Engineering College ( KREC ) Surathkal in 1979 and post graduate in Civil Engineering with\nspecialization in Hydromechanics and Water management from Osmania University,Hyderabad in 1989.

Sengupta\nTitle: High Accuracy High-Performance Computing: Present Status and Future Prospects\nAbstract:With enhanced computing power, importance of high performance computing is evident in all fields of science and engineering. In these activities, the aspects of higher accuracy of scientific computing need more emphasis. Today direct numerical simulation (DNS) of canonical flows is possible with careful computations [1], using dispersion relation preserving (DRP) schemes [2, 3]. These methods are based on mathematical physics of wave propagation requiring spatio-temporal analysis of methods and developing a new branch of studies in computing, the subject of error dynamics in computing.After an introduction of spatio-temporal global spectral analysis of numerical methods showing the flaws of classical approaches of von Neumann analysis, we will focus on examples show casing the power of this analysis with applications. Role of numerical group velocity will be shown, in explaining the existence of q-waves for convection problems. Existence and creation of polygonal vortex in shear driven flows will be described emphasizing the role of mathematical physics of this class of problems. Some issues related to obtaining an equilibrium flow for mixed convection problem will be described. The solution of the classical, unsolved turbulence problem of physics (as stated by Feynman) will be highlighted [4, 5]. Finally, we will discuss about issues of high performance related issues of scientific computing.\nEvent Date: 10th April, 2019(Wednesday)\nEvent Time: 02:00 PM to 03:00 PM\nVenue: Room 203 IIT Dharwad, Karnataka\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

Traditionally evolutionary algorithms are used to optimise the CAD parameters when only black-box evaluation of candidate design is possible. Evolutionary algorithms become expensive for large number of design parameters and their convergence is quite slow compared to gradient-based methods. Algorithmic differentiation (AD) tools can reliably parse sources of large and complex computer codes to produce design sensitivities for gradient-based optimisation with minimum user intervention. With the adjoint mode AD, design sensitivities can be obtained at a computational complexity that scales with the number of output and are independent of the number of design degrees of freedom. Recently at our research group we successfully\ndifferentiated a complex open-source CAD kernel OpenCASCADE and an in-house parallel CFD code to obtain directly the design sensitivities on the CAD parameter space. This allows gradient-based optimisation directly on the CAD parameters. Application top the differentiated CAD-CFD sensitivities to the problem of minimising losses in a Turbomachinery stator vane and drag on an aircraft wing is shown. A novel uncertainty quantification method using adjoint sensitivity called FastUQ is presented with motivation towards application to robust aerodynamic shape design.\nSpeaker Bio:\nDr. Pavanakumar Mohanamuraly is currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at CERFACS, Toulouse, France. He has earned his Ph.D. from Queen Mary University of London, United Kingdom, for the dissertation on Fast Adjoint-assisted Multilevel Multifidelity Method for Uncertainty Quantification of the Aleatoric Kind. He has a MS degree from Pennsylvania State University, USA in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Computational Science. His BTech in Aeronautical Engineering degree is from Madras Institute of Technology (MIT), Anna University.\nHis area of research is on multidisciplinary design optimisation and analysis (MDO) in engineering design workflows which spans CAD-based design and optimisation, multidisciplinary coupling, high-performance computing, and uncertainty quantification (UQ) in aerospace and mechanical engineering.\nEvent Date: 11th March, 2020(Wednesday)\nEvent Time:\n02:30 PM\nVenue:\nRoom No:115\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

Target application domains include design of automobiles, aircrafts and buildings, among others. In this talk we discuss two kernel level modeling primitives.\nFirst, we propose a comprehensive algorithmic framework for computation of solid sweeps. This involves computing the boundary of the swept volume generated by moving the input solid along the input one-parameter-family of rigid motions in three dimensional space. In particular, we\ndiscuss local issues such as the parametrization of the boundary surface, detection and elimination of self-intersections, as well as global issues such as body-check and the topological data associated with the swept volume. Several examples from a prototype implementation in the ACIS modeling kernel will be shown. Applications include CNC machining verification, product handling and collision detection.\nSecond, we demonstrate a robust computational interface for precise modeling of microstructures towards 3D printing. This is achieved through functional composition of B-spline functions and allows separate design of the micro and the macro structures of an object. In particular, we demonstrate construction of recursive, fractal-like microstructures which are composed of trivariate tiles with C0-discontinuities. Applications include design of porous and composite materials.\nThis is joint work with Milind Sohoni, Bharat Adsul and Gershon Elber.\nSpeaker Bio: Jinesh is a researcher in the field of computer aided geometric design. His areas of interest include solid modeling and shape analysis. He obtained his PhD from IIT Bombay and thereafter was a post doctoral fellow at Technion - Israel Institute of Technology.\nEvent Date: 09st August, 2019(Friday)\nEvent Time: 02:00PM\nVenue: Room No. 115\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

In ISF simple tools are programmed to move in predefined paths giving shape to the peripherally clamped sheet in series of local deformations. Double-Sided Incremental Forming (DSIF), uses two tools (one on either side of the sheet), to form the components. Depending on the component geometry, either of the tools forms the geometry while the other provides local support. Complex geometries can be formed in a single setup using DSIF.\nSimple mechanics-based models are developed to accurately estimate tool and sheet deflections during DSIF and are compensated to enhance accuracy. The flexibility of DSIF to form complex geometries is harnessed by recognizing features from topology and geometry information of boundary representation models. A scaled-up DSIF machine capable of forming components up to 1150 mm X 1150 mm, having both the displacement as well as force control options, is designed and developed. Thin plates and shells theory used to predict the sheet deflection, is valid only when the ratio of sheet maximum dimension to thickness is between 10 and 100. Hence, for large components, a multistage methodology is attempted to enhance accuracy.\nThe anisotropic effect studies showed that the thickness is low along low anisotropy direction. This results in low stiffness and high spring-back both in radial and depth directions. The residual stress development mechanism in ISF is studied using Finite Element Analysis, and the residual stresses on formed components are measured using the X-ray diffraction technique. Profile variation with tool movement showed that bending and unbending take place at a point when the tool moves over it, resulted in compressive residual stresses on the outer surface and tensile residual stresses on the inner surface of the sheet.\nSpeaker Bio: Dr. Rakesh Lingam is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Graduate Institute of Ferrous Technology, Pohang University of Science and Technology, South Korea. Dr. Lingam obtained his doctoral degree in mechanical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad and Master’s degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. He also has four years of experience as a software engineer. His research interests include metal forming, plasticity, numerical analysis of forming processes, material modelling, fracture mechanics, computer-aided design, and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), flexible manufacturing processes.\nEvent Date: 20th November, 2019(Wednesday)\nEvent Time: 11:30 AM\nVenue: Room No. 119\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

As a solution the team had developed a sequential clustering algorithm that designs routes for a given set of pickup points and one common drop point. It reduces employee transportation cost for the firm along with focusing on timely pickup and drop off and on-time trips. It manages the allocation of vehicles and designs routes with the bus as a transportation mode incorporating other realistic constraints like changing routes and redefining new routes.\nCongratulations to the team members Rupesh Kalantre, Janhavikumari Dadhania, Harsh Raj, Abhishek Raj and Ashish Kupsad!!!\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

For example, they are used to tackle various challenges in feedforward, iterative learning, and model predictive control, to mention a few. In these and other similar applications, the standard practice is to solve a given control problem by pre-selecting a set of BFs (from a wide range of available options) based on user preference or engineering intuition. Case in point is the emerging filtered basis functions (FBF) approach for feedforward tracking control of nonminimum phase systems using BFs. Rather than the standard practice of arbitrarily selecting BFs, in this talk, I will present a rigorous framework for selecting optimal BFs that minimize control effort or maximize robustness for a desired level of tracking accuracy using the FBF approach. The optimal BFs have been shown in simulations and experiments on 3D printers to yield orders of magnitude improvement in control efficiency and robustness compared to popular BFs like B-splines, while maintaining the same level of (nominal) tracking accuracy. Extensions of my work to parallel configuration 3D printers, extrusion control, metal-based additive manufacturing, big area additive manufacturing, control of nonlinear systems and learning control will also be discussed.\nSpeaker Bio:\nDr. Keval S. Ramani is a Research Fellow at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA. He completed his Ph.D. and M.S. from University of Michigan in 2019 and 2015, respectively, and B.E. from BITS Pilani, Goa Campus, India, in 2012. From 2012 to 2013, he worked with Ingersoll Rand, based in Bengaluru, India, as an Engineering Trainee. His research interests are in dynamic systems and control, with application to 3D printing automation. He is a co-author of the best student paper award winning paper on FBF at the 2015 ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference. He is also a member of the IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics Junior Reviewer Program.\nEvent Date: 19th November, 2020(Thursday)\nEvent Time:\n10:00 AM\nVenue:\nOnline seminar - link https://meet.google.com/oge-pmqw-gbm\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

The mild atmosphere throughout the year and the greenery in the surroundings make it a\npleasant place to live. It is a newly established institute, having only two batches with 227 students\nand a few PhD candidates. One thing that is different in a new institute from other established ones\nis the low number of students...\nSwapnik Jagarlapudi\nCSE, BTech\nWondering how life at a new IIT would be like? Then let me give you my perspective as I was\nhaving exactly the same thought last year before stepping into this institute.\nHailing from a different place and adjusting to the college environment brings its own challenges.\nHowever, at IIT Dharwad, you would quickly adapt to the surroundings here. The climate of\nDharwad is excellent.\nK. Sai Anuroop\nCSE, Btech\nAfter spending almost a year here, I must say my decision to get admitted\nin IIT Dharwad wasn’t wrong.

Some of the key questions are about what kind \t\t\t\t\t\t\tproducts to develop for future, what features the products should have, and which technologies will be required to implement such features. Attention also has to \t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe paid to integration of new, developing technologies that may not be mature today but could be available at some point in future. And all of this needs to be \t\t\t\t\t\ttranslated into actual products in a cost-efficient manner, before the competition, and well before the obsolescence catches up.\nEven when the products are simple, this is not an easy task. For highly engineered products consisting of thousands if not millions of parts, and hundreds of specialised \t\t\t\t\t\t\ttechnologies, this turns out to be a nightmarishly complex undertaking.\nThis lecture is meant as a brief introduction to modern techniques used in the industry for technology forecasting and product development planning processes. An overview of \t\t\t\t\t\t\tvarious methods will be presented along with their relative merits. The methods will be illustrated with relevant examples. Techniques such as scenario planning, \t\t\t\t\t\t\ttechnology foresight (including technology road-mapping, systematic scouting, and IP analytics), and the role of competitive business intelligence will be briefly \t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscussed.\nSpeaker Bio:\nEvent Date: 12th March, 2019(Tuseday)\nEvent Time: 11:35 AM to 12:35 PM\nVenue:IIT Dharwad, Karnataka\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

The operation of helicopter rotors in reverse flow has taken on new significance in the context of co- axial rotors. A rotor moving edgewise at a high advance ratio, encounters reverse flow on parts of the retreating portion of the rotor disc. Predicting rotor stability and pitch link loads is complicated by the presence of unsteady pitch, yaw and rotation effects. Predictions using comprehensive codes have shown large differences from full-scale experimental data. Prior approaches have modeled these using flow separation with airfoil data modified for yaw, vortex shedding, dynamic pitch oscillations and reverse dynamic stall of an airfoil. However, the highly 3-dimensional flow phenomena do not conform to approaches based on 2-dimensional airfoil aerodynamics. The present work delineates the nature of flow around a rotating blade in reverse flow by integrating the results from fixed wing experiments with rotating wing experiments. The work focuses on a strong 3-D vortex similar to those seen on delta wings that would develop over the sharp edge at high yaw, providing an avenue for vortex lift aerodynamic analyses. The fixed wing and rotating wing experiments were performed on a tethered rotor blade with NACA0013 profile. Fixed-wing results from load measurements and flow visualization showed that the sharp-edge vortex (SEV) is a primary feature in reverse flow when the blade is yawed either forward or backward. The aerodynamic loads conform with analytical model using Polhamus Suction Analogy, thus showing significant contributions from vortex-induced lift and pitching moments. The study resulted in better understanding of the physics of reverse flow region. A semi-empirical model based on the delta wing concept was provided as a plug-in module for existing computational tools.\nThe second part of the talk would be focused on the studies carried out in understanding the Bluff body aerodynamics and its application to slung load aeromechanics. Unlike few streamline objects that have some analytical formulation for predicting the aerodynamic loads, the bluff body aerodynamics is a vastly unexplored area. Prior to our studies, in the literature the only experimental studies pertaining to bluff bodies were restricted to 2-D canonical shapes. In practice, a 3-D bluff body would have a highly three dimensional flow and the process of analyzing a complex shape based on its 2-D sectional profiles would greatly limit the out-of-plane components. The work systematically started with developing a Continuous Rotation Technique that would enable in obtaining aerodynamic load maps for for all 360 degree angle orientation on all three principal axes, with 0.5 degree precision. Studies were performed on canonical shapes involving circular cylinders and rectangular prisms for aspect ratios ranging from 0.05 to 4. The studies showed drastic similarities in the aerodynamic loads not only for the same class of object but even between two different classes of canonical shapes. Although the overall flow seemed to be chaotic in nature, a definite and predictable trends in aerodynamic loads started to appear for these canonical shapes. For very low aspect ratio cylinders (AR —> 0) a analytical model based on slender wing concept which is generally used for streamlined objects was found to be a apt solution. In contrast to the widely known 2-D circular cylinder flows in the literature (AR —> infinity), the analytical formulation for a really low aspect ratio cylinder followed by the empirical model for intermediate aspect ratios gave a better understanding of the loads. The results were directly applied to predicting divergent oscillations of a slung load object from a helicopter’s belly. The physics based modeling of slung load a compound pendulum followed by the incorporation of aerodynamic load maps, not only predicted the initial divergent oscillations but also the absolute divergence.\nSpeaker Bio: Nandeesh Hiremath, born in Dharwad, Karnataka, completed his Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering from the PES University, Bangalore in 2013. He was awarded MRD scholarship for maintaining high academic standards. He then joined Georgia Institute of Technology. He completed his Masters degree in Aerospace Engineering in 2015 while working with Dr. Narayanan Komerath. He later completed his Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering in 2018 under his guidance.\nNandeesh has accumulated an impressive portfolio in and out of engineering. For his MS, he developed an analysis and computational model for hypersonic aero-thermo-elasticity, to go with his analysis of liquid-air-cycle engines for air-breathing trans-atmospheric vehicles. His thesis work on rotor blades in reverse flow, and extracting static pressure in complex flows without pressure sensors, is only a part of the story: he has done pioneering work on generalizing bluff-body aerodynamics, while guiding a team of over 10 undergraduates, in numerous projects. His low-key leadership style shuns the limelight while bringing common sense problem-solving and superb organizational skills. He got elected as the Graduate President of Georgia Techs India Club (2016-2017). And India Club under his leadership won Georgia Tech’s Best Organizational Culture award, a first in their long history. He is the recipient of Ray Prouty Scholarship from Vertical Flight Foundation by American Helicopter Society. He was also nominated by Georgia Tech for AIAA/Aviation Week 20 Twenties award.\nEvent Date: 18th September, 2019(Wednesday)\nEvent Time: 11:30 AM\nVenue:Room No.119\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

Currently, I am leading a group of\nresearchers developing power electronic systems for various applications, namely Electric Vehicle Chargers,\nInverters for Grid-tied inverters, and DC Circuit Breakers. I am also strongly involved in teaching various\ncore courses both for undergraduate and post-graduate programs at IIT Dharwad. From July 2018 to January\n2019, I worked for an EV company wherein I was responsible for the development of electric vehicle chargers.\nAnd during my tenure as a post-doctoral fellow at PEMSES - Power Electronics, Microgrids, and Subsea Electrical Systems Center at the University of Houston, Texas, USA, I was responsible\nfor the development of dc circuit breakers for subsea systems. In August 2014, I joined the power electronics\ngroup at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Energy Research (ICER) at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bengaluru, India as a Ph.D. scholar, and received the doctorate in February 2018. My Ph.D. research work\nfocuses on the development of a family of novel multilevel inverters topologies for grid-tied applications. I\nhave also worked on the development of a novel gate driver circuit for MOSFET/IGBT. I received a Master\nof Engineering degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bengaluru, India in\nJuly 2012. From August 2012 to 2014, I worked for the\nDefence Research and Development Organisation\n(DRDO), Ministry of Defence, and I was responsible for the development of high-power radar power supplies.\nResearch Positions at IIT Dharwad\nWe have a full time Masters (M.S) and Ph.D. programme. Applications are called twice a year.

The team built a swarm focused on low-speed stability using Pixhawk as the flight controller and Ardupilot firmware. Using a flooding based communication approach, drones publish their current GPS coordinates for Collision Avoidance and box location to all drones for cross-referencing. GPS coordinates were obtained and appropriate movement commands were sent by Dronekit API which has access to all Ardupilot parameters in real-time. The team used basic OpenCV for object detection instead of a deep learning frameworks approach, taking the low processing power of RPI into consideration.\nCongratulations to the team members Sohan Anisetty, Rishit Saiya, Rishabh Tripathi, Akhilesh Bharadwaj, Akhil Manoj, Shreyas Sathe, Rushikesh Dixit, Aman Singal and Sameer Dohadwalla!!!\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

Such alteration due to presence of oil in the soil voids hypothetically is known to affect various properties of the soil – mainly governed by the water and oil interface. The magnitude of such alteration is anticipated to be higher in clayey soils than sand, owing of their high surface charges, larger surface area and lower particle sizes. A thorough understanding of these effect and risks associated with various engineering activities thus forms a prime step towards developing a sustainable environment. This presentation aims to highlight the influence of increasing palm oil content on the geotechnical properties and flow of a contaminant tracer (NaCl solution of different concentration) through palm oil mixed kaolin clay samples. Discussions include details and analysis of laboratory experiments and findings using state-of-the-art 1D soil column setup and 3D diffusion tests. To this end, the presence of palm oil in kaolin was found to fundamentally alter kaolin’s basic geotechnical properties and transport parameters, which will be briefly discussed before conclude the presentation.\nSpeaker Bio: Dr. Raghunandan is currently working as a Senior Lecturer in Geomechanics at the Civil Engineering discipline, School of Engineering, Monash University Malaysia (2013 – till date). Prior to joining Monash University, Dr. Raghunandan has worked at the University of Regina, SK Canada as a post-doctoral fellow (2011-12). He also had an opportunity to work at the University of Saskatchewan, SK Canada as an exchange student with support from the Canadian Commonwealth Scholarship in 2011. He holds a PhD degree (2007-11) from the IIT Bombay. Dr. Raghunandan’s research expertise focus mainly in the fields of soil dynamics and geotechnical earthquake engineering, behaviour of soil under pavements and machine foundation, ground improvement, environmental geotechnology, and green materials in soil.\nEvent Date: 09th July, 2019(Tuesday)\nEvent Time: 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM\nVenue: Room No 119IIT Dharwad, Karnataka\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

In particular, we are interested in the development of a solution that\ncould be carried on board a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or autonomous underwater vehicle\n(AUV). The motion of aerial and underwater vehicles encompasses the complete six dimensional transla-tional and rotational degrees of freedom, unlike surface vehicles which primarily experience two translational\ndegrees of freedom, and one rotational degree of freedom. This makes the problem of attitude estimation and control more challenging in aerial and underwater vehicles.\nExisting solutions for attitude estimation fall under two flavours: a purely geometric problem involving\nvector measurements, and a geometro-kinematic problem involving angular velocity and vector measure-ments. The former type have analytic solutions for a quadratic output error optimality criterion. The\nlatter type provide asymptotically convergent solutions.We shall show that both kinds of attitude estimation problems may be treated under a single unifying\ngeometric framework. We present theoretical solutions in closed form using this new approach for both problems. The proposed approach also supports a wider variety of optimality criteria for the geometric\nproblem, while yielding faster and more accurate solutions for the geometro-kinematic problem.\nPreliminary experimental work has yielded promising results for the estimator’s performance in com-parison with reported work, for pure rotational motion under laboratory conditions. We are now working\non implementing the estimator on a UAV and verifying its performance in real flight, where the estimator is subjected to both translational and rotational motion.\nPractical implementation of a theoretical solution generates its own set of problems, which we enumerate and propose methods to attack and solve. The inertial sensors are noisy and possess bias, which need to be\nfiltered out and compensated for respectively. This is relatively a straightforward task. The measurement of vectors is also error-prone under practical conditions with translational accelerations and external magnetic\nfields, and compensating for these errors is typically more challenging, if not actually intractable. We propose the incorporation of a low-level visual sense to provide an accurate correction of the residual errors\nin the attitude estimated using the non-ideal inertial sensors. We shall finally validate the implementation of the attitude estimator on a real UAV.\nSpeaker Bio:\nYujendra Mitikiri received his B.Tech. degree in Computer Science and En-gineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, in 2001. He worked as an analog circuits engineer at Texas Instruments from 2001 to 2015.\nWhile at Texas Instruments, he was granted four patents at the US PTO for novel circuit techniques that help in the design of faster, more accurate, and more efficient data converters. He was elected Senior Member Technical Staff\nat Texas Instruments, before he resigned in 2015 to pivot to a competely new engineering field. He received his M.S. degree in Aerospace Engineering from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of\nFlorida, Gainesville, in 2017, and most recently his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the same university in 2020. He has published three journal articles and presented at three\nconferences on topics in the field of control and estimation in autonomous six degree of freedom robots while pursuing his doctorate degree. His research interests include autonomous six degree of freedom robotics,\ncontrol and estimation, nonlinear and geometric methods, sensors and instrumentation, and analog circuits and systems.\nEvent Date: 02nd July, 2020(Thrusday)\nEvent Time:\n03:00 PM\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

What ethics, an ancient branch of philosophy- and apparently a soft, squishy subject- got to do with engineering, a \t\t\t\t\t\t\t'hard - practical- and numbers-driven’ field? Why should engineering students bother with such esoteric topics meant for 'arty-types'? The answer, it turns out, is \t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat with a host of new technologies ranging from AI to CRISPR, the potential to do good as well as harm is very high. The affected entities can be the society at \t\t\t\t\t\t\tlarge, or companies where you may work or even your career! The questions that will have to be faced by the engineers entering the profession now are vastly more \t\t\t\t\t\t\timportant- and grey-than any generation since perhaps the dawn of the nuclear age.\nThis talk will focus on ethical implications of a host of technologies ranging from autonomous cars to predictive policing. In the process, we will see, among other things, \t\t\t\t\twhat one can learn from the Criminal Tribes Act of British India 1871, how tightly coupled algorithms can lead to price manipulation and worse, and why face recognition- \t\t\t\t\t\tthe poster boy of AI success- can be a double edged sword.\nSpeaker Bio:\nEvent Date: 12th March, 2019(Tuseday)\nEvent Time: 10:20 AM to 11:20 AM\nVenue:IIT Dharwad, Karnataka\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

Designing a revenue-optimal mechanism for selling a single item is simple: Set a threshold price based\non the distribution, and sell the item only when the buyer’s valuation ex-ceeds the threshold. However, designing a revenue-optimal mechanism to sell two heterogeneous items is a harder problem. Even the simplest set-\nting with two items and one buyer remains unsolved as yet. The partial characterizations available in the literature have succeeded in solving the problem largely for distributions that are bordered by the coordinate axes.\nWe consider distributions that do not contain (0, 0) in their support sets.Specifically, we consider the buyer’s valuations to be distributed uniformly over arbitrary rectangles in the positive quadrant. We anticipate that the\nspecial cases we solve could be a guideline to understand the methods to solve the general problem. We explore two different methods – the duality method and the virtual valuation method – and apply them to solve the\nproblem for distributions that are not bordered by the coordinate axes.The talk consists of two parts. In the first part, we consider the problem when the buyer has no demand constraints. We assume the buyer’s valua-\ntions to be uniformly distributed over an arbitrary rectangle [c1, c1 + b1] × [c2, c2+b2] in the positive quadrant. We first study the duality approach that solves the problem for the (c1, c2) = (0, 0) case. We then nontrivially ex-\ntend this approach to provide an explicit solution for arbitrary nonnegative values of (c1, c2, b1, b2). We prove that the optimal mechanism is to sell the two items according to one of eight simple menus. The menus indicate that\nthe items must be sold individually for certain values of (c1, c2), the items must be bundled for certain other values, and the auction is an interplay of individual sale and a bundled sale for the remaining values of (c1, c2). We\nconjecture that our method can be extended to a wider class of distributions.We provide some preliminary results to support the conjecture.In the second part, we consider the problem when the buyer has a unit-\ndemand constraint. We assume the buyer’s valuations (z1, z2) to be uni-formly distributed over an arbitrary rectangle [c, c + b1] × [c, c + b2] in the positive quadrant, having its south-west corner on the line z1 = z2. We first\nshow that the structure of the dual measure shows significant variations for different values of (c, b1, b2) which makes it hard to discover the correct dual measure, and hence to compute the solution. We then nontrivially extend\nthe virtual valuation method to provide a complete, explicit solution for the problem considered. In particular, we prove that the optimal mechanism is structured into five simple menus. We then conjecture, with promising\npreliminary results, that the optimal mechanism when the valuations are uniformly distributed in an arbitrary rectangle [c1, c1 + b1] × [c2, c2 + b2] is also structured according to similar menus.\nSpeaker Bio: Thirumulanathan is currently a senior engineer at Qualcomm, Bengaluru. He received his masters and Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Science. His Ph.D. thesis was on designing optimal mechanisms for selling two items. His work has resulted in two papers being published on a core economics journal: Journal of Mathematical Economics. His research interests include game theory, mechanism design, optimization, and data analytics.\nEvent Date: 06th September, 2019(Friday)\nEvent Time: 04:00 PM to 05:00 PM\nVenue:\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

Academic activities at IIT Dharwad commenced in July 2016 with B.Tech course being offered in three core branches, namely, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. The current intake at the institute stands is about 60 students in each of the specializations. PhD program in all 5 sciences and 3 engineering departments commenced from January 2018 session and MS (by research) in three engineering departments commenced from August 2019.\nExisting Campus\nThe current campus of IIT Dharwad has been established within the WALMI (Water and Land Management Institute) campus (135 acres), which is adjacent to Dharwad bench of High CourtBelur, on the National Highway (NH-4) that connects Mumbai-Bengaluru. With the availability of regular transport service, the campus is easy to reach from any point in Dharwad and all the major facilities are within a 10 km radius from the campus. IIT Dharwad is less than 30 km away from Hubbali, the second largest city in Karnataka. WALMI has been generous in providing the necessary infrastructure for the students' hostels, class rooms, laboratories etc.\nPermanent Campus\nThe Karnataka Government has provided about 470 acres of land for the establishment of the permanent campus of IIT Dharwad, which is about 2-3 km away from the transit campus within the WALMI campus. IIT Dharwad has been working at an accelerated pace on campus development and establishment of infrastructure at the permanent campus site.\nAcademics\nIIT Dharwad is committed to provide a receptive and flexible learning environment. The curriculum of IIT Dharwad is modelled on the curriculum of IIT Bombay. We encourage hands-on engineering. First year workshop is taught by a team of faculty from CSE, ME, and EE so that the students are ready to build mechatronic systems! Many courses have course projects where the students are tasked with building a prototype based on the concepts learned in the class. Tinkerer's Lab and entrepreneurship cell are in the pipeline. Our library is well equipped with nearly 2000 books and provide access to more than 3000 research journals. The required infrastructure for academic activities such as large and small class rooms, Physics and Chemistry Labs, Workshop and Computer Lab has been established. Instructional and research facilities are being established with state-of-the-art equipment. Above all, highly experienced and renowned professors add substantial value to the academics at IIT Dharwad.\nLocation\nIIT Dharwad is on the outskirts of Dharwad, which is part of the twin cities of Hubballi-Dharwad in the north of Karnataka. With pleasant climate year round, Dharwad is famous for its academic institutions. Dharwad is a picturesque locale positioned between the Western Ghats (Malenadu) and the Deccan Planes (Bayalu Seeme). Dharwad derives its name from the Sanskrit word \"DWARAWATA.\" The twin cities are well known for their culture, literature and the Indian freedom movement. The historic Fort of Kittur, where Rani Chennamma fought the British in 1824, is just 20 km away from the IIT Dharwad campus.\nAnnual Report\nDownload PDF(2019-20)\nDownload PDF(2018-19)\nDownload PDF(2017-18)\nDownload PDF(2016-17)\nGST Registration Number and Contact Details\nRegistered Name of the instituteIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad\nRegistered Address of the instituteWALMI Campus, NH4, Next to Dharwad High Court, Dharwad 580011\nPAN No.AAAGI0111B\nGST No.29AAAGI0111B1Z8\nGST ARN No.AA29071086081X\ndated July 10, 2017\nState of RegistrationKARNATAKA\nContact Person Name,Designation and emailProf. S.

Rayleigh-Bénard convection is one of a kind of natural convection which has been widely studied due to its importance in practical applications. This thesis details effect of anisotropic thermal diffusion on thermal convection inside tilted domains. A kinetic theory-based lattice Boltzmann method with multiple relaxation time collision formulation (LB-MRT) is employed. This approach uses double distribution functions to simulate the thermal convection inside the two-dimensional domains and three distribution functions to simulate the mixed convection inside a cylindrical cavity with an axisymmetric domain. The mathematical formulations of 2D LB-MRT and LB-MRT with an axisymmetric approach for anisotropic thermal diffusion and domain tilt are explained. A detailed discussion on the validation, parallel computation and performance is given. The benchmark studies of differentially heated 2D cavities, Rayleigh Bénard convection in a square cavity, and natural convection in diagonally ‘flipped-L’ shaped enclosures are performed. Further, Rayleigh-Bénard convection in tilted rectangular, square, ‘L’ shape, and diagonally ‘flipped-L’ shape cavities are studied. The steady Rayleigh-Bénard convection is observed for ‘L’ shape and diagonally ‘flipped-L’ shape cavities at low Rayleigh numbers. However, for higher Ra numbers, unsteadiness in the flow structure is observed. This unsteady behavior of the flow is then characterized by using the time-dependent signal of spatially averaged Nusselt number on the hot wall. The effect of anisotropic thermal diffusion on the Rayleigh-Bénard convection inside a cylindrical cavity using the axisymmetric approach is studied. The Rayleigh number is limited up to Ra = 104 to produce axisymmetric flow structures without azimuthal velocity. Further, the effect of a domain tilt on the convection is discussed. Next, the effect of mixed convection with an anisotropic thermal diffusion on the bubble breakdown with a rotating top and the stationary bottom lid is investigated. The code is first validated for fluid flow inside the lid-driven cylindrical cavity without thermal effects. The validation is also carried out for the convection inside the hot rotating top-lid cavity. The effect of mixed convection on the Bodewadt boundary layer thickness and the temperature boundary layer thickness is investigated. The simulation studies are performed for various Reynolds numbers, Richardson numbers, and Rayleigh numbers. It is concluded that the Bodewadt boundary layer thickness and the temperature boundary layer thickness are directly proportional to the Richardson number. For anisotropic thermal diffusion the Bodewadt boundary layer thickness remains constant and temperature boundary layer thickness increases for certain Richardson number with an increase in the ratio of thermal diffusivity values. The bubble breakdown vanishes with an increase in the Richardson number at a constant Reynolds number. Lastly, major conclusions from the present thesis work are discussed and the future directions are given.\nSpeaker Bio:Amitkumar completed schooling from Pimpri-Chinchwad area in the Pune city, Maharashtra, India.

However, creating distributed-memory solutions involves the challenges of task creation, program and data partitioning, communication optimization, and task scheduling. In this work we present D2P, an end-to-end system for automatically transforming a specification of any recursive DP algorithm into distributed-memory implementation of the algorithm. When given a pseudo-code of a recursive DP algorithm, D2P automatically generates the corresponding MPI-based implementation. Our evaluation of the generated distributed implementations shows that they are efficient and scalable. Moreover, D2P-generated implementations are faster than implementations generated by recent general distributed DP frameworks, and are competitive with (and often faster than) hand-written implementations.\nSpeaker Bio: Nikhil Hegde is a PhD candidate in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, USA advised by Prof. Milind Kulkarni. He obtained his master's degree from IIT Madras in 2005, and bachelor's degree from B.M.S.College of Engineering, Bangalore in 2002, both in Computer Science and Engineering. He is interested in the broad areas of high-performance computing, and programming languages. Currently, his research focuses on distributed-memory parallelism of irregular applications.\nHe also has over eight years of professional experience working in the industry developing hardware, middleware, and software.\nEvent Date: 01th March, 2019(Friday)\nEvent Time: 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM\nVenue: Room 119 IIT Dharwad, Karnataka\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

Then let me give you my perspective as I was\nhaving exactly the same thought last year before stepping into this institute.\nHailing from a different place and adjusting to the college environment brings its own challenges.\nHowever, at IIT Dharwad, you would quickly adapt to the surroundings here. The climate of\nDharwad is excellent.\nK. Sai Anuroop\nCSE, Btech\nAfter spending almost a year here, I must say my decision to get admitted\nin IIT Dharwad wasn’t wrong. Being an institute of national importance, it\nprovides top facilities to its students. The institute is being mentored by IIT\nBombay, for the time being.

The department is renamed in the year 2019. Since its inception, the Department has been offering a four-year B.Tech. programme in Mechanical Engineering at an undergraduate level. At the postgraduate level, the Department offers research programs such as M.S. (by Research) and Ph.D. programs.\nThe Department’s B.Tech. (Mechanical Engineering) curriculum offers a distinct combination of courses with sound conceptual understanding together with practice-oriented learning elements. The theoretical rigor is imparted from a selection of courses in basic sciences and interdisciplinary topics in addition to subjects from the core mechanical engineering curriculum, which are backed by an array of hands-on laboratory courses.\nThe list of laboratory courses as they appear in the present B.Tech. (Mechanical Engineering) curriculum is:\nEngineering Graphics Laboratory\nHands-on Engineering Laboratory\nChemistry Laboratory\nPhysics Laboratory\nComputer Programming Laboratory\nMachine Drawing and 3D Modeling Laboratory\nFluid Mechanics Laboratory\nManufacturing Processes and Metrology Laboratory\nStrength of Materials Laboratory\nMechanical Measurements Laboratory\nKinematics and Dynamics of Machinery Laboratory\nHeat Transfer Laboratory\nManufacturing Processes Laboratory\nApplied Thermodynamics Laboratory\nApart from these laboratory courses, students are encouraged to do hands-on course projects and demonstrations during the theory courses. For details regarding the presently prescribed credit structure for the BTech (Mechanical Engineering): click here\nSeveral students from the recently graduated first batch of students were placed in core sector, PSUs and IT sector. Quite a few students from the first two batches are pursuing their Master's degree from the leading institutions in India and from abroad.\nThe faculty of the Department work on various core research areas and also on an expansive list of interdisciplinary research areas. The research areas of all institute faculty members are available here. The problem statements from domains such as materials (composites (Prof. Tejas Gotkhindi); plasticity (Prof. Rakesh Lingam)), and aerospace (CFD (Prof. Dhiraj Patil), aero-acoustics (Prof. Meenatchidevi Murugesan), and turbomachinery aerodynamics (Prof. Keerthi MC.)) are also tackled with enthusiastic undergraduate students and research scholars. The Department is poised to take on both global as well as local problems such as energy technologies for sustainable environment, healthcare and agricultural technologies, and other key needs of the nation.\nFor faculty details click here.\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

The merits of high bandwidth and low loss over long distances has made optics the choice for long distance signaling. Optics has now made its advent for rack to rack and even intra rack connectivity in Datacenters, which are the hub of network activity consisting of 10s of 1000s of compute nodes. However, there is still throughput bottleneck encountered due to speed limitation of electrical signaling in the backplanes of network racks. This talk will discuss the possibities to bring optics to shorter distance contexts.\nSpeaker Bio: Krishnan Rengarajan is an Analog Mixed Signal Circuit Design Engineer with experience\nspanning several areas including High Speed Serial Links, Discrete volatile and non-volatile memories, Compiler SRAMs/CAMs for ASICs, DRAM chips, OTP/MTP/eFuse memories, 622Mbps Clock recovery IP, and Clock generation chips,Designs using FPGAs for HDTV system, MCMs for printer control and System design for printers.

Accordingly, there is a close collaboration between industry and academia through various programs such as internships, campus placements, sponsored projects, work-integrated learning programs and consultancy. The recent mandate by the Government of India on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spending by corporates has opened up yet another exciting opportunity for further strengthening the partnership between industry and academia, especially the IITs, including IIT Dharwad.\nIIT Dharwad provides a unique opportunity for corporates in creating a societal impact via CSR activities. Being a new Institute, it brings in an environment of great energy and enthusiasm through the young and highly qualified faculty members, and allows flexibility to align with the CSR objectives of corporates. Moreover, the location of the Institute, in the northern part of Karnataka, affords an opportunity to work for the development of this region in various areas, such as education, agriculture and health-care. There is thus a greater scope for carrying out CSR activities through our valued partnership. Finally, IIT Dharwad being\na premier Institute in the region, there is a scope for deploying various facilities, which can be accessed by surrounding educational institutions for teaching and research.\nWe, at IIT Dharwad, call on corporates and industry to partner with us in identifying the societal problems that require technological intervention and to provide a technology driven solution for those problems.\nPlease find the brochure here: Click Here\".\nContact Us\n+91 836 2212 839\ncsr@iitdh.ac.in\n© 2019\nAll Rights Reserved | Design by W3layouts"

An L(3,2,1)-labeling of a graph G is a function f from the vertex set V(G) to the set of non-negative integers such that for any two vertices x,y, if d(x,y) = 1, then |f(x) − f(y)| ≥ 3; if d(x,y) = 2, then |f(x) − f(y)| ≥ 2; and if d(x,y) = 3, then |f(x) − f(y)| ≥ 1. The L(3,2,1)-labeling span λ(G) of G is the smallest positive integer n such that G has an L(3,2,1)-labeling with n as the maximum label.

Namely, why is it that when we look at parallel lines in space, we actually observe them converging to a point?\nAnd why do different families of parallel lines seem to converge to different points? Rather than study points and lines in space, we will study the images of points and lines in our vision, in order to answer these questions. In fact, using ``homogeneous coordinates\" we can make mathematically precise statements about the images we see.\nThe mathematical laws these images obey are different from the usual ``Euclidean\" laws that we are used to studying, but nevertheless give rise to a rich geometric structure.\nEvent Date: 23rd October, 2019(Wednesday)\nEvent Time: 4:30 PM\nVenue:\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

These grafts, however, suffer from disadvantages such as lack of growth potential, have limited durability, and are associated with an increased incidence of repeated surgeries. The field of stem cell-based tissue engineering aims to provide alternative living substitutes that restore, maintain or improve tissue function. In this talk, I will present our results on (i) some of the aspects of our translational approaches in the development and characterisation of indigenous acellular tissue-engineered xenografts which help to bridge the gap from bench to bedside, (ii) strategies for three-dimensional (3D) human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human hepatic organoid using hyaluronic acid-based hydrogels and bioprinting technology for liver tissue engineering.\nSpeaker Bio:\nSantosh Mathapati received his PhD (2013) and a Master's degree in Biotechnology and Medical Biotechnology from IIT Madras, India respectively and a Bachelor’s degree in Veterinary Science from the Bombay Veterinary College, Mumbai. He joined as an Assistant Professor at Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, Haryana in July 2019. He did his postdoctoral fellowship from the University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway (2014-1017). He worked in the industry: Frontier Lifeline Hospital (Cardiac care hospital), Chennai, Synkromax Biotech Pvt Ltd (Medical device start-up), Chennai and HCL Technologies (as an SME Medical Device Biocompatibility), Chennai.

Regardless of the academic character of benchmark tests on highly simplified homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), fundamental statements can be made about the numerical method itself and the development of turbulence models. In the presented work, stability, consistency, and accuracy of commonly used lattice Boltzmann schemes are investigated by means of numerical experiments on direct numerical simulation (DNS) of decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence (DHIT). As a paragon for Kolmogorov's theory on HIT, the Taylor-Green vortex is chosen as a benchmark problem and numerical solutions are evaluated in terms of global turbulence quantities. Intermediate Reynolds numbers and two-parameter scalings are used to investigate mesh-convergence of the LBM. The results give insight into essential differences of the distinct collision schemes and enable further recommendations on parameter choices.\nSpeaker Bio: Stephan Simonis is a Ph.D. student at the Institute for Applied and Numerical Mathematics at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany. He obtained his master's and bachelor's degree at KIT, both in Mathematics, and spend a funded exchange year (ERS+) at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden. Currently, his research focuses on discrete velocity models, relaxation systems and lattice Boltzmann methods for partial differential equations. As a part of the interdisciplinary Lattice Boltzmann Research Group headed by Dr. Mathias J. Krause, he contributes to their open-source framework OpenLB (www.openlb.net) which addresses a vast range of transport problems (e.g. in CFD) with LBM and allows for fast implementation in both, academic testing and advanced engineering applications.\nEvent Date: 01st August, 2019(Thursday)\nEvent Time: 02:30PM\nVenue:\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

Bose in 1895, led to the opening up of a new window to the Universe. India has a strong tradition in this new field of radio astronomy, starting with Prof. Govind Swarup who kicked off activities in this area at TIFR in 1963.\nIn this talk, we will trace the fascinating story of Radio Astronomy and the engineering behind it, with special emphasis on its growth and current status in India, ending with the frontline Indian facility -- the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). The GMRT, a world class low frequency radio observatory operational since 2002, consists of 30 fully steerable antennas of 45 metre diameter each and can be used as an aperture-synthesis array for imaging, as well as a phased array to study compact radio sources such as pulsars.\nIt uses several interesting and innovative ideas and technologies. We have recently completed a major upgrade of the GMRT that is targeted to improve its sensitivity by a factor of upto three and make it a much more versatile instrument. This upgrade, which employs some cutting edge new technologies, will keep the GMRT at the forefront as one of the most sensitive facility in the 100 to 1500 MHz range for the next decade or so. In this talk, we will look into some of these technological aspects of the GMRT, and also take a quick look into how it has improved our understanding of the Universe, and what the future holds\nSpeaker Bio:\nProf.\nYashwant Gupta is the Centre Director of National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA), Pune, since March 2018.\nHe did his B. Tech. in Electrical Engineering from IIT Kanpur (1985) and MS and PhD in Radio Astronomy from University of California San Diego (1990).\nHe is a recipient of Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar 2007 (Physical Sciences) and the URSI Young Scientist award 1996 (at the XXV General Assembly of the URSI, Lille, France). He heads the Indian Team in the international Square Kilometre Array (SKA) where we have the PATH FINDER status, due to our successful commissioning of GMRT and its upgradation.\nHe is the Science Director for India\nin SKA. He is in the Scientific Advisory Board of many Institutions, such as the Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie, Bonn, Germany. He is the Chair, Software Committee, of the Thirty Metre Telescope (TMT) and Member, Governing Council for IIA. GMRT was the largest Interferometric Array when it was built (Govind Swarup and team, 1984-1996).\nEvent Date: March 13, 2021 (Saturday)\nEvent Time:\n03:30 PM\nStreaming link at: https://sites.google.com/iitdh.ac.in/national-science-day-2021\nEvent poster: Link\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

However, creating distributed-memory solutions involves the challenges of task creation, program and data partitioning, communication optimization, and task scheduling. In this work we present D2P, an end-to-end system for automatically transforming a specification of any recursive DP algorithm into distributed-memory implementation of the algorithm. When given a pseudo-code of a recursive DP algorithm, D2P automatically generates the corresponding MPI-based implementation. Our evaluation of the generated distributed implementations shows that they are efficient and scalable. Moreover, D2P-generated implementations are faster than implementations generated by recent general distributed DP frameworks, and are competitive with (and often faster than) hand-written implementations.\nEvent Date: 20th March, 2019(Wednesday)\nEvent Time: 04:30 PM\nVenue: Room 23 IIT Dharwad, Karnataka\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

J\nTitle: Novel First Order Bayesian Optimization\nAbstract:Zeroth Order Bayesian Optimization (ZOBO) methods optimize an unknown function based on its black-box evaluations at the query \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlocations. Unlike most optimization procedures, ZOBO methods fail to utilize gradient information even when it is available. On the other hand, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst Order Bayesian Optimization (FOBO) methods exploit the available gradient information to arrive at better solutions faster. However, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tutilizing the gradient information in the FOBO methods incur severe computational cost. Further, the inherent sequential nature of the FOBO methods \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the problem of noisy gradient information exacerbates the computational overhead as well as the underlying parameter estimation problem, \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlimiting their wide applicability. To alleviate the aforementioned difficulties of FOBO methods, in this talk we propose a simple statistical model \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto leverage the gradient information and present novel FOBO methods that search for global optima effectively.\nFurthermore, we explore application \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the proposed FOBO methods in the context of policy gradient reinforcement learning.\nSpeaker Bio: Prabuchandran K.J. is an Amazon-IISc Postdoctoral scholar at IISc, Bangalore. He holds\nPh.D. from Department of Computer Science \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand Automation, IISc in the area of Reinforcement\nLearning. Post his PhD, Prabuchandran worked as Research Scientist at IBM Research Labs, India \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor an year and half on change detection algorithms for multivariate compositional data. His research lies in the intersection of reinforcement \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlearning, stochastic control & optimization, Machine Learning, Bayesian Optimization and stochastic approximation algorithms.\nHis research \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterest also focuses on utilizing techniques from these fields in solving\nproblems arising in applications like wireless sensor networks, traffic \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsignal control and social networks.\nEvent Date: 20th March, 2019(Wednesday)\nEvent Time: 02:30 PM to 03:30 PM\nVenue: Room 23 IIT Dharwad, Karnataka\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

The problem statement for this year's hackathon was: Roads' Leasing and Maintenance System. The team had to design a system for the government within 36 hours that could crowd-source data about road construction progress and also collect road quality feedback from the citizens. The team came up with a working prototype SAFE - Society for Accident Free Environment, with the strategy \"Check and Balance\" where the contractor claims their progress and the citizens verify it. The team introduced gamification techniques and a social-media inspired user interface to encourage crowd-participation. There were two parts to the system:\n(i) Mobile Application: A portable app that can be used by citizens and contractors on the go.\n(ii) Web-based Dashboard: A GUI for detailed analysis and statistics, which will allow government officials to manage and resolve issues efficiently.\nCongratulations to the team members Charu Agarwal, Srishti Srivastava, Aman and Sonu Sourav!!!\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

The impact has been across the entire spectrum of network devices in the internet, specially more pronounced in wide area networks. Network programmability facilitates the definition of new services, both in the provider domain as well as in application-oriented clouds. The path towards achieving programmability lies in allowing sufficient flexibility in the control-plane as well as the data-plane. Software Defined Networks (SDNs) certainly address the former aspect of bringing programmability into control-planes. Data-plane programmability can be a game-changer for networks as services can now better leverage network resources leading to a better quality of experience.\nCurrent data-planes are built using merchant silicon, which in particular makes the system rigid due to match-action relations that are pre-set in the hardware and show limited programmability. To this end, we proposed Bitstream, which is an SDN based approach towards bringing in programmability in the data-plane along with the control plane by defining programmable parsing behavior of packets/services that can be mapped to data-planes. Bitstream also allows interacting with P4 through APIs, P4 has evolved as a tool to allow programmability in hardware. Parsing mechanism of the Bitstream makes it protocol agnostic, resulting in Bitstream to adapt any existing/new networking protocol.\nSpeaker Bio: Aniruddha Kushwaha is a Postdoctoral researcher in the Gigabit Networking Laboratory at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. He completed his Ph.D. in 2019 from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT-Bombay. He is the recipient of Google India Ph.D. Fellowship-2016. At IIT-Bombay, he contributed to the development of series of indigenous Carrier Ethernet switch routers for DRDO and ECIL, which are deployed in various networks such as MTNL, RailTel etc. He has published his work in journals such as IEEE JLT, JOCN and conferences such as IEEE ICC, GlobeCom, OFC etc.\nHe also serves as an associate editor for Springer journal Wireless Networks. His research interests are in software defined networking, programmable network, networking protocols and datacenter architecture.\nEvent Date: 09th January, 2020(Thrusday)\nEvent Time: 11.30 AM to 12.30 PM\nVenue: Room No. 119\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

To accomplish such cooperative tasks autonomously, the agents are required to coordinate with each other depending on their sensing capabilities, which is represented by a graph (usually referred to as communication network).\nThe first part of my talk will focus on achieving a collective motion in multi-agent systems where the agents are either in a synchronized or a balanced formation. Such formations are characterized by the motion of the collective centroid of the group of agents and serve as motion primitives to achieve general tracking patterns. In the existing literature, the problems of achieving synchronization and balancing have been studied under the assumption that the agents are coupled through controller gains that are identical or homogeneous. In this talk, I plan to discuss a practical scenario where the gains may vary nominally due to minor implementation errors or drastically due to major faults or errors, thus leading to heterogeneity in controller gains. Robustness and fault tolerant properties of these formations against the failure of controllers will also be presented. Furthermore, stabilization of more general formation patterns, such that the trajectories of the agents do not transgress a given workspace, will also be discussed.\nThe second part of my talk will focus on cooperative control of heterogeneous dynamical systems that possess shortage of passivity or non-passiveness in their operation. Due to passivity-shortage, the convergence of the network is not guaranteed in the closed loop operation, which is usually the case in practice. An input-output transformation based\ngeneralized passivation approach will be discussed to ensure their passivity properties in terms of maximal equilibrium passivity, which is a generalization to the classical passivity theory. We then show that the steady-state behavior of these systems are in fact solutions to a family of classic network optimization problems, and as a result we draw connections between notions of duality in static optimization to cooperative control. Finally, the presentation will be concluded by a brief discussion about some future directions of the work.\nSpeaker Bio:Dr. Anoop Jain is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Technion – Israel Institute of Technology. His research at Techion is funded by the Lady Davis Fellowship.

I strongly believe that IIT Dharwad is the best\namong all new IITs. Peaceful atmosphere, pleasant climate and blowing wind year-round fills the\ncampus with positive energy, making it the best place for study. We enjoy staying with students from\nvarious parts of India having different cultures. Students are very vibrant and competitive. Here\nstudies are perfectly balanced with extra-curricular activities for the students to achieve an overall\ndevelopment. Cultural programs, student club activities, competitions, workshops and talks are\nregularly held here. Staff and TAs are always helpful. Professors here are experts in their respective\nfields and are very friendly. They provide the students with excellent technical knowledge. This\nbacked by good labs, library and infrastructure by institute, ensures that students get best\nknowledge. Projects and research are encouraged by college. We have SHIFT lab run by students to\nmake their own projects, funded by institute to get innovative approach of learning.\nAt IIT Dharwad, students always find themselves in a pool of never ending opportunities!\nSwapnik Jagarlapudi\nCSE, BTech\nIIT Dharwad is situated by the national highway at the outskirts of the city of Dharwad in the state of\nKarnataka. The mild atmosphere throughout the year and the greenery in the surroundings make it a\npleasant place to live. It is a newly established institute, having only two batches with 227 students\nand a few PhD candidates. One thing that is different in a new institute from other established ones\nis the low number of students. Most people come to know each other and there is an atmosphere of\nfriendliness and familiarity. It is also easier as a result to build a personal rapport with the professors\nand faculty, who are all supportive and helpful to the students and help them in any way they can. As\nthere aren't as many students, it is also easier to approach professors and get their help, which is not\nsomething found in established institutes. This is my first time living away from home, however, I\ncould adjust quickly the hostels are great and my room already feels like my second home. The mess\ncommittee has been working hard to ensure the quality and hygiene of the food and they have been\ndoing a great job so far. I have learnt a lot of new things since joining IIT Dharwad. The most valuable\nthing, however, is that the system makes the student develop their ability to think for themselves -\nbe it an exam or a lab session or just a lecture, the professors, who have a lot of experience working\nin their respective fields, impart their knowledge in a way that makes the student think for\nthemselves and figure something out. Joining IIT Dharwad has undoubtedly been one of the best\ndecisions I have taken.\nK. Sai Anuroop\nCSE, Btech\nWondering how life at a new IIT would be like? Then let me give you my perspective as I was\nhaving exactly the same thought last year before stepping into this institute.\nHailing from a different place and adjusting to the college environment brings its own challenges.\nHowever, at IIT Dharwad, you would quickly adapt to the surroundings here. The climate of\nDharwad is excellent. Especially, if you’re from a metro, you would really take a breath of fresh\npollution-free air and find yourself a lot closer to the nature here.\nThe student community here is quite vibrant, amicable and culturally diverse. There are different\nstudent clubs in which you could participate and engage in various activities. Sports facilities are\ncoming up quickly and our teams have already represented IIT Dharwad in the Inter IIT Sports\nMeet 2017.\nLet me tell you about the academics here.\nWe are currently being taught by both the visiting professors from IIT Bombay and the permanent\nfaculty of IIT Dharwad. Our academics include both theory and the concerned lab courses which\ngo hand in hand. Academics are undoubtedly the best part of our IIT. The atmosphere here is\nsuch that you would really enjoy learning, both in and outside the classroom. You could even\nattend the invited lectures and workshops conducted here. The institute provides a great\nenvironment for the holistic development of students.\nI’ve given you a glimpse of life at IIT Dharwad. It’s really exciting to be an IITian here!\nAmeya Vadnere\nCSE Department\nAfter spending almost a year here, I must say my decision to get admitted\nin IIT Dharwad wasn’t wrong. Being an institute of national importance, it\nprovides top facilities to its students. The institute is being mentored by IIT\nBombay, for the time being. The academic curriculum is framed in an\nappropriate way, suitable for imparting crucial technical knowledge to students.\nEmphasis is laid on developing a logical and innovative mind. Certain lab courses\nare included in the curriculum which provide invaluable hands-on experience.\nThe labs are equipped with state-of-the-art apparatus. For students lagging in\nacademics, there are faculty advisors assigned to each branch. We also have\nspecial lectures quite often delivered by well-versed professors on different\ntopics like Physics, Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, History, Astrophysics,\nQuantum Mechanics, Linguistics, Literature, Socio-Economic issues, Counselling,\netc. These lectures evoke curiosity in students’ minds. We also have interesting\nsummer projects. The hostels and academic building have internet connection\nthrough Wi-Fi. The sports facilities are good and students can learn to play a\nsport they like. Hence the students get exposure to help them blossom their\ntalents. Thus, IIT Dharwad has a plethora of things to do and learn. I recommend\ntaking admission into IIT Dharwad.\nWomen Help Desk\nIIT Dharwad\nTestimonials\nIIT Dharwad\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

I strongly believe that IIT Dharwad is the best\namong all new IITs. Peaceful atmosphere, pleasant climate and blowing wind year-round fills the\ncampus with positive energy, making it the best place for study. We enjoy staying with students from\nvarious parts of India having different cultures. Students are very vibrant and competitive...\nVivek Mishra\nBtech, Electrical Engineering\nIIT Dharwad is situated by the national highway at the outskirts of the city of Dharwad in the state of\nKarnataka. The mild atmosphere throughout the year and the greenery in the surroundings make it a\npleasant place to live. It is a newly established institute, having only two batches with 227 students\nand a few PhD candidates. One thing that is different in a new institute from other established ones\nis the low number of students...\nSwapnik Jagarlapudi\nCSE, BTech\nWondering how life at a new IIT would be like? Then let me give you my perspective as I was\nhaving exactly the same thought last year before stepping into this institute.\nHailing from a different place and adjusting to the college environment brings its own challenges.\nHowever, at IIT Dharwad, you would quickly adapt to the surroundings here. The climate of\nDharwad is excellent.\nK. Sai Anuroop\nCSE, Btech\nAfter spending almost a year here, I must say my decision to get admitted\nin IIT Dharwad wasn’t wrong. Being an institute of national importance, it\nprovides top facilities to its students. The institute is being mentored by IIT\nBombay, for the time being. The academic curriculum is framed in an\nappropriate way, suitable for imparting crucial technical knowledge to students...\nAmeya Vadnere\nCSE Department\nWomen Help Desk\nTestimonials\nView More\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

Energy systems is a multi-disciplinary research area primarily spanning electrical and chemical engineering disciplines. Control and optimization of energy systems play a central role in production intensification and ensuring operational safety. Having a reliable mathematical model is pivotal in achieving this goal. More often than not, developing a physics-based system model is not feasible or computationally too expensive for complex energy systems. My research addresses this issue through data-analytics based proxy/surrogate modeling, which are computationally affordable modeling techniques used in control and optimization studies. Given that the research in data analytics across the globe is in full-swing, it is the right time to explore more on the experimental/simulation data-based strategy to model and control dynamical systems, especially the complex ones. The multi-disciplinary nature of the problem will be of interest to academia as well as industry.\nSpeaker Bio:\nAjay Ganesh is a systems and control researcher having a multi-disciplinary academic background in electrical and chemical engineering. Having a Bachelor`s in Electronics & Communication Engineering, he received his Master’s in Control & Computing from Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, in 2014. He pursued his Ph.D. in Process Control from Chemical and Materials Engineering Department, University of Alberta, and graduated in 2019. He has been working at the UD since January 2020. His academic training and research have helped him specialize in Data-driven Modeling & Control of Energy Systems, Process systems engineering, Machine learning techniques, Optimal control, Graph Theory, and Matrix computations. Exposure to systems and controls from both electrical and chemical engineering perspectives has enhanced his understanding and appreciation of the intricacies associated with the interdisciplinary nature of the area.\nEvent Date: 27th November, 2020\nEvent Time:\n09:30 AM\nVenue:\nOnline seminar - link http://meet.google.com/ajd-rbtx-ghf\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

While we observe the planets of our Solar system we also show a good interest for deep sky objects further out like Clusters and Nebulae. For the enthusiatic astronomer , this is a place to observe , discuss and reason out the remarkable phenomenon that we see beyond the Earth's atmosphere.\n2018\nApril 10\nAstronomy Night\nAcademic Building Terrace\n9:00 PM\n2018\nApril 04\nStargazing\nAcademic Building Terrace\n10:00 PM\n2018\nFEB 04\nLearners 101\nAcademic Building Terrace\n9:00 PM\nAt IIT Dharwad we believe in learning by doing and have many intellectually challenging projects yet to be taken.To know more about our projects or start a new one in this club please contact\nProfessor in-charge : R Prabhu\nEmail : prabhurama@iitdh.ac.in\nAstronomy Night\n×\nTime : 9:00 PM\nVenue : Terrace of the Academic building.\nWe explain the concepts of Celestial Sphere, Right Ascension and Declination. We then demonstrate an equatorial mount for our Telescope.An attempt will be made to focus on the Jupiter (rising around 9 PM !! and very close to the Moon) or Aldebaran (Rohini) setting around 10 PM ! Betelgeuse - Sirius are other possible targets.\nStargazing 101\n×\nTime : 10:00 PM\nVenue : Terrace of the Academic building.\nPreviously, our Astronomy Session was constrained to viewing just Moon, and occasional planets (and Rotighar!?) D Narasimha wants to take one step forward regarding this. He can explain to us how to properly operate the telescope, what and how much can we see through this telescope (we may be able to look for deep sky objects (Nebulae, Star Clusters)). He wishes to take a session of about 60-90 min tomorrow.\nPhotography Club\nPhotography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving.

Network Functions (NFs) or traditionally the middleboxes are the basis of realizing different types of in-network services such as security, optimization functions, and value-added services. Typically, multiple NFs are chained together (also known as Service Function Chaining) to realize distinct network services, which are pivotal in providing policy enforcement and performance in networks. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is becoming more prevalent and enabling the softwarized NFs to fast replace the traditional dedicated hardware-based middleboxes in Communication Service Provider (CSP) networks. However, Virtualized Network Function (VNF) chains posit several systems and network level resource management and failure resiliency challenges: to ensure optimal resource utilization and performance at the system level; and at the network-level to address optimal NF placement and routing for service chains, traffic engineering, and load balancing the traffic across Virtualized Network Function Instances (VNFIs); and to provide High Availability (HA), Fault Tolerance (FT) and Disaster Recovery (DR) guarantees.\nThis talk presents an NFV resource management framework to realize efficient, scalable and resilient network service chaining. The presented solutions enable to improve scalability, performance, resource-utilization efficiency, and resiliency of deploying the NF chains in SDN/NFV ecosystem and are based on the standardized ETSI MANO NFV reference architecture. We address system-level NF resource utilization, performance, and scale challenges by designing a userspace NF scheduling framework for service function chains. We present a novel rate-cost proportional scheduler and chain-aware backpressure mechanisms to optimize the resource utilization through judicious Central Processing Unit (CPU) allocation to the NFs and improve on the chain-wide performance. We address network-level challenges i.e. orchestration and management of NF chains through a semi-distributed resource management framework that can efficiently instantiate, place and relocate the network functions and to distribute traffic across the active NF instances to optimize both the utilization of network links and NFs. We address HA and FT for NF chains through a novel NF state replication strategy and distinct mechanisms to provide timely detection of NFs, hardware node (Virtualized Network Function Manager), and network link failures. We exploit the concept of external synchrony and rollback recovery to address non-determinism and significantly reduce the amount of state transfer required to maintain consistent chain-wide state updates. We provide distinct failover mechanisms for individual NF failures and global service chain-wide failures with strict correctness guarantees.\nSpeaker Bio: Sameer G.

With faculty from varying research backgrounds, the department encourages multi-disciplinary research allied with computer science, applied physics, biotechnology, chemistry and computation. Undergraduate and graduate students will study and work on some of the exciting research problems in a wide variety of subjects, both theoretical and experimental. The EE Department has active collaborations with numerous industries and academic institutions, both in India and abroad. The EE Department highly encourages graduate/undergraduate students to take up internships in research labs across the globe. The faculty at EE Department are mainly working in the areas of next generation wireless communication such as IoT, 5G and beyond, communication networks, performance modeling, resource allocation, sensors, circuits and devices, control engineering, machine learning and deep neural networks, signal processing, speech processing, power systems and power electronics. These research activities are carried out in our advanced laboratory facilities at the institute.\nDonation\nThe EE Department has attracted several bright graduate (MS and PhD) students in the recent past to pursue research under the supervision of young faculty members of the department. The department is in its formative years, and in order to compete globally in research, students and faculty need to conduct high quality research with great impact. The funds towards this come from various government and private agencies on a competitive basis. Oftentimes, these funds do not support all the research needs of the students such as travel support for presenting their papers in\ninternational conferences. Further, funds towards contingency/working expenses are also limited. Therefore, there is a need to support research by adding resources to our existing funds. In addition, since this is a new institute, as of now, we do not have a very strong alumni network who can contribute. The department has started an initiative where we seek\ngenerous contributions from the public, and we will always remain thankful to the contributors.

However, with time, the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria (so-called superbugs) is currently proving to be a serious and increasing threat to human health and medicine. Therefore, discovery of new structural motifs with novel antibacterial targets exhibiting activity against multi-drug resistant pathogens is urgently required. Mother nature provides untapped potential for discovering novel antibiotics and in this need of the hour, scientists from different disciplines can join efforts in exploring such bioactive natural products and their derivatives to bring out the best weapons to continue our fight against the superbugs. This talk will cover a brief overview of antibiotics and current strategies that can be employed to create new drug like molecules from bacteria using a combination of chemistry and biology.\nSpeaker Bio: Nilkamal Mahanta, currently an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry, IIT Dharwad, obtained his Ph.D. in Chemistry (with Prof. Tadhg Begley in Bioorganic Chemistry and Enzymology) from Texas A& M University, Texas, USA. He continued his post-doctoral studies at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, USA (with Prof. Douglas Mitchell) in Chemistry and Chemical Biology of antibiotic ribosomal natural products. His research interests are in the interface of chemistry and biology and wants to study bioactive natural products, organic chemistry of enzymes, and medicinal chemistry.\nEvent Date: 13th March, 2019(Wednesday)\nEvent Time: 4:30 PM\nVenue: Room No. 23 IIT Dharwad, Karnataka\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

It is even more so when the product, as in the robotics domain, is multi-disciplinary in nature and entails diverse skill sets across design, development, manufacturing, sales and service. Problem solving skills that need to be developed beyond the classroom to address real-world issues will be illustrated with a few case studies across multiple disciplines. At a higher level the fundamentals in our eco-system that impede the full intellectual potential of India to be leveraged to realize globally competitive products can be debated.\nSpeaker Bio: Dr. Jagannath Raju is the Chief Technology Officer of Systemantics, and is responsible for the company’s product development and technology strategy. He incubates product ideas based on market requirements and leads their development into full-fledged products. His consulting experience in the USA covers development of innovative robotic systems for space, underwater and hazardous applications for projects funded by NASA, Federal Sea Grant Program, Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. He also served as a consultant in the Boston area to many companies involved in robotics and automation R&D, especially in semiconductor fabrication and handling, and was a visiting scientist at the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan under a fellowship from Japan’s Ministry of International Trade and Industry.\nAfter relocating back to India in 1994 he worked as a consultant to the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Bangalore for the development of a controller for a robotic inspection platform before founding Systemantics in 1995. His expertise covers many areas of technology relevant to robotic systems, viz., mechanical design, actuator and sensors, computer control, signal and power electronics and embedded and application software. Jagannath is a B Tech from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, and holds a master’s degree from the University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA, and master’s & doctoral degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.\nEvent Date: 31th January, 2019(Thrusday)\nEvent Time: 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM\nVenue: Room No. 119 IIT Dharwad, Karnataka\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

For many years now, SDR or digitally reconfigurable radio research has been quite challenging with only\na few reported practical prototypes with limited success. In this talk, an intermediate solution to SDR receiver implementation called “Mini-SDR” architecture is discussed by exploiting the concept of bandpass sampling. Based on the proposed Mini-SDR architecture, three CMOS radio frontends are discussed: (1) a standalone electronic attack (EA) transceiver system, (2) dynamically reconfigurable multi-standard subsampling (DRMS) radio receiver and (3) a dual-\nband subsampling receiver for IEEE WLAN 802.11ac standard.The first architecture is a single chip integrated transceiver for a standalone EA system based on digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) repeater without the need for a separate instantaneous frequency measurement (IFM) receiver. This work reports the first sub-Nyquist bandpass sampling based single chip architectural solution for a standalone EA system where\nRF frontend and digital controller are integrated into the system. The second architecture is the DRMS radio receiver. The proposed receiver has a unique capability to detect the carrier frequency of the incoming signal, estimate its bandwidth and standard. The complete receiver architecture has been verified to detect and process three different bands belonging to three\ndifferent standards (GSM, UMTS and WLAN). The third architecture is the first dual-band subsampling receiver with subsampling frequency optimization to meet ultimate receiver error vector magnitude (EVM) of −40 dB. This IEEE 802.11ac WLAN dual-band subsampling receiver test-chip implemented in 1.2V 65-nm CMOS technology to prove the proposed\nconcepts, including major system level, circuit level and layout level optimizations. This talk concludes with the success story of “Mini-SDR”.\nSpeaker Bio: Dr. Vijaya Sankara Rao Pasupureddi held a tenured Associate Professorship until March, 2019 at the Department of Integrated Systems and Circuits Design, School of Engineering and IT, Carinthia University of Applied Sciences (CUAS), Austria, Western Europe\nand now, Dr. Vijay Sankar is a tenured Professor Designate from August, 2019 in the same department along with the research partnership from Silicon Austria Labs.

Graph algorithms are irregular, i.e memory access patterns varies with each graph object. Graph algorithms analyze and transform a graph object to discover graph properties or to apply a computation. For instance a community detection algorithm discovers likely communities in a social network. In Domains such as social information systems, the number of edges can be in billions or trillions.\nGraph algorithms can be executed on multi-core CPUs, GPUs with thousands of cores, multi-GPU devices, and CPU+GPU clusters, depending on the size of the graph object. Inorder to program such algorithms on heterogeneous targets, a programmer is required to deal with parallelism and also manage explicit data communication between distributed devices. This implies that a programmer is required to learn CUDA, OpenMP, MPI, etc. and also the details of the hardware architecture. Such codes are error prone and difficult to debug.\nThe talk will focus on,\nFalcon, a graph Domain Specific Language ( DSL) for data analytics on graph, and its compiler. The compiler is developed as part of the PhD work of Dr.Unnikrishnan C. Falcon programs are explicitly parallel and Falcon hides all the hardware and communication details from a programmer. Falcon support distributed systems with CPU and GPU. Another feature of Falcon is that it supports mutation of graph objects and thus enables programming dynamic graph algorithms.

The department currently has two regular faculty members and one guest faculty. In addition, several guest professors from other IITs have served the department from time to time in teaching and research, establishing laboratories etc. The department also has a regular junior technical superintendent to assist with various pedagogical activities.\nThe department currently offers a B. Tech level core course named “Chemistry for Engineers: Fundamental concepts and applications (CH101)” for all branches of the engineering students in every fall semester. This course encompasses several disciplines of chemistry with an industrial application-oriented approach. In addition, a “Chemistry Laboratory (CH111)” course has also been designed to assist the theory course which focuses on hands-on training of chemical principles of day to day life with various thought-provoking experiments. In every spring semester, the department also offers another core course namely “Environmental Studies (CH301)” for all branches of the engineering students. Currently, an elective course is also offered in collaboration with other departments namely “Sustainable energy and energy materials (CH302)”.\nAt the PhD level, the department offers various interdisciplinary courses (topics in chemistry, molecular spectroscopy, polymer and materials science etc.), courses in organic and biological chemistry (organic reaction mechanisms, bioorganic chemistry and chemical biology), inorganic chemistry (inorganic and organic photochemistry, coordination and organometallic chemistry) and physical chemistry (statistical thermodynamics, kinetics and computational chemistry). The department aims to design a master’s level research-based course in chemistry in the near future.\nIn terms of research, the department has an active PhD program with interdisciplinary research areas such as organic photochemistry, polymer and materials chemistry, bioorganic and medicinal chemistry, and chemical biology. Currently the PhD students enter the program either in teaching assistant (institute funded), fellowship (CSIR/UGC) and/or project (external funding agencies such as DST/CSIR/DBT) categories. The faculty members also have secured research and consultancy funding from various government and private agencies for carrying out fundamental and transformational research. In terms of research facilities, the department has several modern equipment (such as NMR, IR, UV-Vis and fluorescence spectrophotometer, chemical fume hoods, glove boxes and other essential instruments) for conducting cutting edge research across boundaries. In addition, several instruments are housed in the central instrumentation facility (such as AFM, SEM, XRD, TEM etc.) which could be used for various transdisciplinary research. Being in a new and vibrant institute, the department has active collaboration with various engineering and science departments within the institute as well as with several other institutes in India and abroad. The faculty members often publish in journals of national and international repute from time to time. The department holds regular student seminars, journal clubs and other guest seminars on current areas of chemistry and beyond and actively participates in several educational and research outreach activities of the institute. The department also takes part in collaborative activities with nearby educational institutes (such as KUD, UAS, KLE, SDM etc.) to serve the community in and around the Hubli-Dharwad region.

Octagonal shape, abundant natural light, and cool breeze make the readers comfortable in the library. It is equipped with quality furniture and fittings which are added advantages. It is also climate controlled. Apart from the main area, it has two rooms on either side of the entrance. One room consists of research carrels for serious study. Another room houses the books, apart from some space for reading. In all about 100 readers can occupy the reading area.\nThe collection consists of nearly 4750+ books in various disciplines. These are arranged subject wise. It has also acquired a few ISO standards (International Standards Organization) in digital form.\nAt present, the main motto is to build up the Library collection such that it has information resources up to Ph.D. level, including advanced texts and reference materials.\nIIT Dharwad is a Life Member of prestigious “Current Science Association” of “Indian Academy of Sciences”, and receiving “Current Science” journal. It also receives some national newspapers and light reading magazines. Very soon, some popular S&T magazines will be at readers’ disposal, which will make young minds aware of recent happenings in the scientific world. Being a part of Inflibnet -eShodhSindhu, the serious readers can access nearly 7000+ reputed E-Journals (Cambridge, Oxford University, Springer, T&F etc.), Elsevier ScienceDirect 05 Subject Collection, Databases (MathSciNet, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Electronic Library, JSTOR, Project Muse etc.) and Society Publications (ACS, AIP, APS, ASME, OSA, ACM etc.) literature retrospectively. This collection is the bread-n-butter for the Institute’s research scholars and faculty members to quench their thirst for state-of-the-art knowledge.\nThe Library also houses, a dedicated photocopying facility.

In 2021, IIT Dharwad introduced the B.Tech. programme in Engineering Physics. Currently, IIT Dharwad is following a credit based curriculum with Semester Performance Index (SPI) and Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) systems.\nDetails of undergraduate students\nBatch\nNo. of Students Enrolled\nNo. of students Graduated\n2016 -2020\n113\n104\n2017 - 2021\n114\n-\n2018 - 2022\n117\n-\n2019 - 2023\n126\n-\n2020 - 2024\n161\n-\nWhat is unique about the B.Tech programme in IIT Dharwad?\nHands-On Engineering: quick exposure to the latest/advanced technology/tool without compromising on the basic/required understanding.\nDiversified Curriculum through One-Credit Courses: The Institute blends engineering, science and social science courses with short courses from performing arts, visual media, language communication and fine arts. One-credit courses in dance and music are part of the B.Tech curriculum from August 2018. A basket of new courses in photography, painting and foreign languages such as French, Japanese, German is also coming soon.\nHolistic Learning Approach: IIT Dharwad believes in exposing young minds to a wide array of experiences that shape and reinvent their outlook to the world. A young student would find multiple creative and critical avenues on campus to explore such as Clay Modelling, Film Making, Astronomy Nights among others, that intend to expand the boundaries of learning itself. Students are allowed to take all their electives from any department in the Institute (subject to prerequisites) including basic sciences, humanities, other engineering departments etc.\nCo-Op program: In this program, a student is allowed to do a project under the supervision of a faculty member at IIT Dharwad and a mentor from an industry. The motivation for the program is driven by the belief that engagement with state of the art (in industry/academia) complements student learning inside the Institute portals. IIT Dharwad aims to facilitate stronger interaction with the industry/academia for interested students (and through them, faculty).\nUndergraduate Labs\nIIT Dharwad possess technologically equipped multiple classrooms with varied capacity. The laboratories own all essential resources and state-of-the-art equipment to provide a best training for the students.\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.

To realize an economically-independent, environmentally-sustainable and socially- responsible future\nrequires the support of technically-sound, scientifically-rigorous and contextually-relevant solutions. This is where the role of design thinking becomes pivotal.\nDesign as ‘planning for change’ is the engine for innovation in all forms. It cuts across all facets of the innovation ecosystem and connects them together.\nIt is a knowledge-intensive activity that spans both problem-finding-and-formulation and problem solving to ensure development of feasible solutions that contextually fulfil functionality and improve the quality of life.\nDesign Thinking is frequently analogized to business today. It is important to recognize that Design Thinking is not exclusive to designers or unattainable to those in another discipline. Design Thinking is an approach to inquiry and expression that complements and enhances existing skills, behaviors and techniques.\nLeaders are looking to find something new to grasp onto in order to make sense of what’s going on and to prepare for a future of unprecedented uncertainties.\nThe talk would expose the students to basics of Design Thinking and would have some hands-on experience to understand design thinking better,\nwhich would help participants shape their career better.\nSpeaker Bio: Professor Bhavin Kothari is Senior Faculty with Strategic Design Management discipline at National\nInstitute of Design (NID). Prof Kothari is a qualified Engineer–Planner from CEPT University and has pursued another master in Intellectual Property Rights from NALSAR University. He has more than\n20 years of experience.Prof Kothari has generated special interest in circular economy and related areas. He has actively worked to facilitate and generate Intellectual Property (IP) awareness in designer fraternity in general and NID in particular. Prof Kothari has been instrumental in revamping Strategic Design Management curriculum at NID besides developing, strengthening and delivering it.\nProfessor Kothari is innovation specialist and likes mentoring corporate on strategically designing their organizations imbibing ‘Design Thinking’ and ‘Innovation Management.’ His professional\ninterest also includes Organization Design and Designing Business Models for the Creative Industries.Prof Kothari has good knowledge about the emerging trends and paradigms in the field of Strategic\nDesign Management and circular economy with a research aptitude. He has been trained in Design Management through Association for Overseas Technical Scholarship (AOTS) at Japan. Prof Kothari\nhas published, attended, organized and presented at many forums and conference in the areas of his expertise.Strategic Creativity, Design Planning, Intellectual Property, Innovation Management, Change\nManagement, Design Audit, Craft Incubation and management, Business Model Innovation,Organisation Design, Circular Economy are few of his main areas of academic and research interests. He is faculty mentor for the design management at NID.Professor Kothari is an active member of International Association of Innovation Professionals. He is Executive Board Member of the Gujarat Innovation Society. Professor Kothari is mentoring Gujarat Technological University to incorporate Design Thinking in their engineering curriculum of all the streams. Prof Kothari helped in setting up National Institute of Design at Kurukshetra, as\nfaculty advisor for the education programme.Professor Kothari supports Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) initiative of NITI AYOG, GoI. Prof Kothari has been a party to help the Innovation Initiative support task force especially to develop Innovation Tool-Kit initiated by the Prime Minister’s Office. Prof Kothari is faculty mentor for his student, recipient of the Schmidt-MacArthur Fellowship programme of Ellen MacArthur Foundation on Circular Economy.

It is also the fundamental basis for quantum-mechanical uncertainty relations as explained by Heisenberg. Diffraction results in transverse spreading of the electromagnetic fields as they propagate in freespace which in turn reduces the peak power along the direction of propagation. These diffraction effects can be easily observed in the propagation of a Gaussian beam in freespace as shown in Fig. 1. There exists a class of beams that propagate without transverse spreading after the plane where the beams are formed. These are solutions to the Helmholtz wave equation and are referred to as nondiffracting beams. Examples of such beams are the Bessel, the Airy, the Mathieu, the recently introduced nondiffracting beams based on second order differential equations (SOD) and higher even ordered differential equations (HEOD), the parabolic beams and the nonparaxial Mathieu and Weber beams.\nIn addition to this nondiffracting nature, the Airy, the SOD and the HEOD based beams also self accelerate or bend in free space. These properties open the door for new practical applications of such beams in both free space (i.e. micrometer and mm-wave) and guided (i.e. optics) propagation modes. For example, efficient wireless power transfer over long distances of few hundreds of meters, enabling high data rate communications using orbital angular momentum beams in combination with the nondiffracting beams, non-line-of-sight communications in congested wireless environment due to curved nature of the nondiffracting beams, communication around impenetrable buildings and other structures and biomedical wireless sensing around sensitive human tissue to name a few. Based on previous contributions to the field of nondiffracting beams by our research team and other research groups, this seminar will provide an introduction to the properties and some potential applications of such beams.\nSpeaker Bio: Dr. Ravi Kadlimatti received his PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York (SUNY), USA in Feb. 2017. He received the M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University at Buffalo, SUNY, USA, in 2012 and the Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from B.M.S. College of Engineering, Visvesvaraya Technological University, Bangalore, INDIA, in 2010. He served as a Lecturer in the Dept. of Electrical Engineering at the University at Buffalo in 2013. He is currently working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Advanced Wireless Systems Research (ADWISR) Center in SUNY, Oswego. Dr. Kadlimatti has several journal and conference publications in the areas of mismatched filters, design of good codes and good code sets for multistatic/MIMO radar and multiuser communications applications and nondiffracting beams. He was nominated for the Best Student Paper Award in the 2016 IEEE Radar Conference.\nEvent Date: 01st October, 2019 (Tuesday)\nEvent Time: 02:30 PM to 03:30 PM\nVenue: Room No. 115\nIndian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Karnataka, India - 580011.\npro@iitdh.ac.in\n+91 836 2212 839\nQuick Links\nGallery\nContact Us\nEmotional Wellness Services\nCSR Projects\nAnnouncements\nEvents\nNews\nFaculty Recruitment\nNon-Faculty Recruitment\nTenders\nAcademics\nUndergraduate\nDoctoral\nCurriculum\nCalendar\nResearch\nFaculty Areas of Research\nSponsored Projects\nConsultancy Projects\nWorkshops\nPublications\nCampus life\nCampus life\nStudent life\nPermanent Campus\nPeople\nFaculty\nStaff\nAbout\nAnnual Report\nBoard of Governors\nFinance Committee\nDirector\nInternal Complaints Committee\nGrievance\nRTI\nSC-ST-OBC Liaison Cell\nChief Vigilance Officer (CVO)\nAbout Dharwad\nCopyright 2021 @IITDH.
